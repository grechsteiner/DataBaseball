# Initializing database with Python and MySQL

NOTE: not the final database!

Make sure Python and MySQL are installed locally

In your project terminal, run:

`pip install mysql-connector-python python-dotenv pandas`

Create a .env file with your local MySQL db's login info. For example:

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=69ROX!


NOTE: DO NOT upload your .env file. Some MySQL local db's don't have a password, so you can leave it blank.

Run

`python -u initTables.py`

Make sure the relevant .csv files are in the same directory
